/**
 * This struct holds useful information about a speech sample audio file. It

 * techniques where it is important to have matching begin and end locations.
 * For example, even if a word is uttered at different speed and pitch. The
 * begin and end points should mark the exact beginning and end of the spoken 
 * word.
 *
 * max_peak : The maximum peak in amplitude values from 0 .. 1 of the sample.
 * normalization_factor : Use this factor to normalize any given value of the
 * file (mostly used internally).
 * threshold_start_time : The identified begin-time of the spoken word within
 * audio file. 
 * threshold_end_time : The idenfitied end-tim of the spoken word within the
 * audio file.
