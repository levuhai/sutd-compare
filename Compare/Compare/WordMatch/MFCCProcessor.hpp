     * This class calculates the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients from a
     * packet of mono-channel frames. The conversion consists of the following
     * steps: 
     *
     *      ] Pre-Emphasis (a high-pass filter)
     *      ] Applying a Hamming Window to the packet
     *      ] Calculate spectrum magnitues
     *      ] Frequency warping according to the Mel-Scale
     *      ] Applying the Discrete-Cosine-Transform (DCT II) on the warped
     *        frequency bins. This results in the cepstral coefficients.
     *
     * An excellent explanation of these transformations is found in 
     * "Speech and Language Processing", Chapter 9, pg 329 ff. by D. Jurafsky
     * and James Martin.
     *
     * This class uses mostly vectorized versions of transformations using the
     * vDSP framework and should therefore provide very good performance on 
     * Mac OS X and iOS devices (iOS 4 required).

         * components. As literature suggest, you should set this window to a
         * a length of ~ 20 - 30ms. Consider a window_overlap of 1/3 - 1/2
         * of the window size. (e.g. for 16khz a window of 320 frames with a
         * sampling rate of 100hz for an overlap of 1/2 is ok. Note that you can

         * care of zero-padding the FFT buffers properly automatically.

         * the MFCC's is to pre-emphasize the signal, i.e. to boost higher 
         * frequencies that have been suppressed during sound production of 
         * humans. The filter is given as s2(n) = s(n) - pre_emph_alpha*s(n-1), 
         * where a suggested value of pre_emph_alpha should be between 
         * 0.96 .. 0.99.

         * MFCC's will be calculated from.

         * Mel-Frequency warping (for a sampling rate of 16khz this is usually
         * 133.33 HZ)
         * @param mel_max_freq The maximum frequency to be considered during
         * Mel-Frequency warping (for a sampling rate of 16khz this is usually
         * around 6855). This value must not be greater than the nyquist limit
